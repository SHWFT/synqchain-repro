# SynqChain Next.js MVP - Acceptance Checklist

This checklist verifies that all requirements have been implemented and are functioning correctly.

## âœ… Repo Hygiene

- [x] `/login` works, sets cookie; middleware guards app pages
- [x] Only `/app` directory remains (no `/src/app`)
- [x] `.env.example` contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_ERP_ADAPTER=file-fixture` and `SQLITE_DB_PATH=./prisma/dev.db`
- [x] README.md has simple quick start: `npm i`, `npm run dev`, app on `http://localhost:3000`

## âœ… Type System & ERP Integration

- [x] `erps/mapping/common.types.ts` created with Zod schemas
- [x] `erps/adapters/adapter.types.ts` created with ERPAdapter interface
- [x] `erps/adapters/mock.adapter.ts` created with pagination support
- [x] `getERPAdapter()` defaults to `file-fixture` if no env var set
- [x] ERP mock endpoints return paginated fixture data
- [x] No TypeScript errors; no missing imports

## âœ… Database & Persistence

- [x] SQLite database layer with `better-sqlite3`
- [x] Automatic table creation for suppliers, projects, purchase_orders, po_events
- [x] Suppliers/Projects/POs CRUD via API (SQLite)
- [x] PO submitâ†’approve updates status and writes an event/audit row
- [x] Pagination and search functionality working

## âœ… API Endpoints

- [x] GET/POST `/api/suppliers` - list with pagination/search, create
- [x] GET/PUT/DELETE `/api/suppliers/[id]` - get, update, delete by ID
- [x] GET/POST `/api/projects` - list with filtering, create
- [x] GET/PUT/DELETE `/api/projects/[id]` - get, update, delete by ID
- [x] GET/POST `/api/po` - list with filtering, create
- [x] GET/PUT/DELETE `/api/po/[id]` - get, update, delete by ID
- [x] POST `/api/po/[id]/submit` - submit for approval
- [x] POST `/api/po/[id]/approve` - approve PO
- [x] GET `/api/po/[id]/events` - get audit trail with pagination
- [x] GET `/api/analytics/kpis` - server-side KPI calculation

## âœ… Authentication & Security

- [x] Demo login API (`demo@demo.com` / `demo`) sets HTTP-only cookie
- [x] Logout API clears authentication cookie
- [x] Middleware redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- [x] Protected routes: `/dashboard`, `/projects`, `/suppliers`, `/po`, `/analytics`, etc.
- [x] Cookie security settings (httpOnly, secure in prod, sameSite: lax)

## âœ… Client Integration

- [x] `lib/client/api.ts` fetch wrapper with error handling
- [x] Convenience methods for all resource APIs
- [x] Auth methods for login/logout/me
- [x] Proper error handling and toast integration ready

## âœ… Health & Monitoring

- [x] GET `/api/healthz` checks database connection
- [x] Returns proper JSON with health status and timestamp
- [x] Returns 503 status on database connection issues

## âœ… Analytics & Charts

- [x] Analytics cards/charts read from `/api/analytics/kpis`
- [x] Server-side KPI computation using SQLite aggregations
- [x] Monthly chart data for projects completed and savings
- [x] Date range filtering support with query parameters

## âœ… Testing

- [x] Playwright smoke test configuration
- [x] Login flow test with navigation between pages
- [x] CRUD operations test (create/delete supplier)
- [x] Health check endpoint verification
- [x] API endpoints respond properly

## ðŸš€ Deployment Readiness

### Environment Setup

- [x] SQLite database file at `./prisma/dev.db`
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Development server starts without errors

### Code Quality

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] No console errors in development
- [x] Proper error handling throughout
- [x] Consistent API response formats

### Next Steps for Production

- [ ] Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for production
- [ ] Add proper user management and authentication
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Add data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Set up database migrations
- [ ] Add backup and recovery procedures

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Testing Checklist

To verify everything works locally:

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm i
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Test authentication:**
   - Should redirect to `/login`
   - Login with `demo@demo.com` / `demo`
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`

3. **Test navigation:**
   - Visit `/projects`, `/suppliers`, `/po`, `/analytics`
   - All pages should load without errors
   - Unauthenticated access should redirect to login

4. **Test API endpoints:**

   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/healthz

   # List suppliers
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/suppliers

   # Analytics KPIs
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/kpis
   ```

5. **Test ERP integration:**

   ```bash
   # Mock supplier data
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/erps/mock/suppliers

   # Mock items
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/erps/mock/items

   # Mock purchase orders
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/erps/mock/purchase-orders
   ```
